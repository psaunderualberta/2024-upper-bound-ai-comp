        "# **Puddle World**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this guide, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough on preparing the Puddle World environment for the Competition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, we cover the installation of the environment and related dependencies, both for local setup and utilization within a Colab notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we detail the process of initializing the environment with desired configurations and demonstrate how to visualize its characteristics. The goal of the competition is to design an agent that does well in the five provided configurations. Therefore, we show you how to load all the various versions of the environment and inspect their characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the objective of designing a competent agent, we present suggestions for deploying random, human, or untuned DQN agents within the environment. Observing all these different baseline behaviors serves as a valuable starting point for your work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, it's time to design and train a single agent capable of superior performance across the five configurations of the environment. Testing the agent on these configurations, with the first being the default environment as described in the paper, is crucial. We provide instructions on saving results in a CSV file for submission, marking the beginning of your journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're new to the field and eager to explore or an experienced practitioner aiming to refine your skills, this competition provides a platform to utilize your knowledge and creativity!"

The environment is initialized and visualized, providing a starting point for the agent to explore the world. The random agent **selects actions randomly from the action space and applies them to the environment**. This process is repeated for a predetermined number of time steps (in this case, 10 steps). After each step, the agent's reward is accumulated, and the interaction is visualized through rendering the environment. Finally, the total reward earned in the total time steps is displayed, and the sequence of frames captured during the interaction is saved as a video for further analysis. This random agent serves as a baseline for you to see how the environment works and prepare for the performance of more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithms in the Puddle World environment."

The environment is initialized and visualized to provide a starting point for the human agent's interaction. Unlike the random agent, the human agent inputs actions directly from you. You are prompted to enter actions through the command line interface, allowing for real-time interaction. The key mapping is as follows:\n",

This process is repeated for a predetermined number of time steps (in this case, 10 steps). After each step, the interaction is visualized through rendering the environment. The total reward earned in the total time steps is displayed, and the sequence of frames captured during the interaction is saved as a video for more analysis. This human agent setup enables you to actively engage with the environment and assess its dynamics and challenges from a human perspective."

        "In this section, a  [ Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) is utilized to interact with the Puddle World environment. The code demonstrates how to set up training with [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/), a popular library for reinforcement learning. The DQN model is initialized and trained using default hyperparameters, but you can explore and adjust these hyperparameters for optimal performance. After training, the trained model is loaded for evaluation. The environment is initialized, and the DQN agent's interaction with the environment is visualized. The agent selects actions based on the learned policy, and the environment responds accordingly. This process continues until the episode terminates. At the end of the episode, the total reward earned by the agent is displayed, and the sequence of frames captured during the interaction is saved as a video for further analysis. While the provided code serves as a starting point for training a DQN agent with stable baselines if you wish to use this library, you are encouraged to experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the agent's performance in navigating the complex dynamics of the Puddle World environment. We encourage you to explore more algorithms in the same library or build your agents from scratch."
